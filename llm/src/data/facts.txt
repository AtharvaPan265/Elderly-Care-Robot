Tippi Hedren, full name Nathalie Kay Hedren, born on January 19, 1930, in New Ulm, Minnesota, is an American actress, former fashion model, and humanitarian best known for her work in Alfred Hitchcock’s classic films. Before entering the film industry, she enjoyed a successful career as a model in New York City, appearing in numerous magazines and television commercials. Her elegant beauty and distinctive poise caught the attention of Hitchcock, who discovered her after seeing her in a television advertisement in 1961.
Hitchcock cast Hedren in the lead role of The Birds (1963), a suspenseful thriller that became one of his most iconic works. Her portrayal of Melanie Daniels brought her critical acclaim and the Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer. The following year, she starred opposite Sean Connery in Marnie (1964), another Hitchcock psychological drama that solidified her reputation as a talented and complex performer. However, her collaboration with the director was also marked by tension and control, and their professional relationship ended after Marnie, leading Hedren to pursue her career independently.
In the years that followed, Hedren continued to act in film and television, though she increasingly dedicated herself to humanitarian and animal welfare causes. Deeply moved by her experiences while filming Roar (1981), a movie that involved working closely with lions and tigers, she founded the Shambala Preserve in Acton, California, as a sanctuary for big cats rescued from circuses and private owners. Her foundation, the Roar Foundation, has since become a leading voice in the protection and ethical treatment of wild animals.
Beyond her activism, Hedren’s legacy also extends through her family. She is the mother of actress Melanie Griffith and grandmother of Dakota Johnson, both of whom followed her footsteps into acting. Throughout her life, Hedren has remained a figure of elegance, resilience, and purpose — a woman who transformed Hollywood fame into a platform for compassion and advocacy. In recognition of her contributions to film and philanthropy, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2003, sealing her place as both a cinematic icon and a champion for animal rights.
