# SCR Robot - Project Setup Complete! ✓

## What Has Been Created

Your gesture recognition system is now ready to use! Here's what has been set up:

### 📦 Virtual Environment
- ✅ Python virtual environment created in `venv/`
- ✅ All dependencies installed

### 📄 Project Files

1. **requirements.txt** - Package dependencies
   - opencv-python (Camera & video processing)
   - mediapipe (Hand tracking AI)
   - numpy (Math operations)

2. **gesture_recognition.py** - Main gesture recognition system
   - Detects hands in real-time
   - Recognizes 6 different gestures
   - Visual feedback with hand landmarks

3. **test_setup.py** - System verification script
   - Tests package imports
   - Verifies camera access
   - Confirms MediaPipe functionality

4. **robot_controller_example.py** - Robot integration template
   - Shows how to connect gestures to robot commands
   - Template for actual robot control
   - Includes gesture stability checks

5. **README.md** - Complete documentation
6. **QUICKSTART.md** - Quick reference guide
7. **.gitignore** - Git configuration

## 🎯 Recognized Gestures

Your system can recognize these 6 gestures:

| # | Gesture | Robot Command | Description |
|---|---------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | 👍 Thumbs Up | Come here / Yes | Robot approaches user |
| 2 | 👎 Thumbs Down | Go away / No | Robot retreats |
| 3 | ✋ Open Palm | Stop | Immediate halt |
| 4 | ✌️ Peace Sign | Confirmed | Acknowledge/Option 2 |
| 5 | ✊ Fist | Hold | Maintain position |
| 6 | 👌 OK Sign | All good | Everything OK |

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Test Your Setup
```bash
cd /Users/jakegiannotto/Desktop/SCR\ Robot
source venv/bin/activate
python test_setup.py
```

### 2. Try Gesture Recognition
```bash
python gesture_recognition.py
```
- Your camera will open
- Show your hand to the camera
- Try different gestures
- Press 'q' to quit

### 3. Integrate With Your Robot

When you're ready to connect to actual robot hardware:

1. Open `robot_controller_example.py`
2. Replace the `TODO` comments with your robot's actual control code
3. Run the robot controller:
   ```bash
   python robot_controller_example.py
   ```

## 📝 Important Notes

### Camera Permissions
The first time you run the camera, macOS will ask for permission:
- System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Camera
- Enable for Terminal (or your IDE)

### Best Practices for Gesture Recognition
- **Lighting**: Good, even lighting is crucial
- **Background**: Plain backgrounds work best
- **Distance**: Keep hand 1-3 feet from camera
- **Clarity**: Show entire hand, make deliberate gestures
- **Stability**: Hold gestures for 1-2 seconds

### Customization Options
You can easily customize:
- Add new gestures (modify `gesture_recognition.py`)
- Change detection sensitivity (adjust confidence thresholds)
- Map gestures to different commands (edit `robot_controller_example.py`)
- Adjust cooldown times between commands

## 📚 File Reference

- **QUICKSTART.md** - Quick commands and gesture reference
- **README.md** - Detailed documentation and troubleshooting
- **gesture_recognition.py** - Core recognition code
- **robot_controller_example.py** - Robot integration template
- **test_setup.py** - Diagnostic tool

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **OpenCV**: Camera access and image processing
- **MediaPipe**: Google's hand tracking ML model
- **NumPy**: Mathematical operations

MediaPipe provides:
- 21 hand landmarks per detected hand
- Real-time tracking at 30+ FPS
- Works in various lighting conditions
- No training required

## 🎓 Learning Resources

Want to customize further? Here are key areas to explore:

1. **MediaPipe Hand Landmarks**
   - 21 points tracked on each hand
   - Thumb tip = ID 4
   - Index tip = ID 8
   - See MediaPipe documentation

2. **Gesture Logic**
   - Located in `recognize_gesture()` method
   - Based on finger extension detection
   - Distance calculations for complex gestures

3. **Robot Integration**
   - Template provided in `robot_controller_example.py`
   - Includes command cooldown system
   - Gesture stability checking

## 🐛 Common Issues

**"Camera not found"**
- Close other apps using camera
- Check camera permissions
- Try unplugging/replugging external cameras

**"Gesture not detected"**
- Improve lighting
- Show entire hand
- Hold gesture longer
- Check if hand is in frame

**"Import errors"**
- Activate virtual environment first
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 💡 Next Development Ideas

Once basic system is working, consider:
- [ ] Add gesture history/logging
- [ ] Implement two-hand gestures
- [ ] Add distance estimation
- [ ] Create gesture sequences (combinations)
- [ ] Add sound feedback
- [ ] Record gesture training data
- [ ] Build custom gesture trainer
- [ ] Add wireless robot control
- [ ] Implement safety boundaries
